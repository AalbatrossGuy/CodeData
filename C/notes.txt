a. if enum direction {up, down, left=10, right}, then up will be 0, down will be 1 but left will be 10 (because we explicitly defined it to be 10) and right will be 11 as it appears right after left.

b. enums are treated as integer constants.

c. If set, char var = 65 or any other int, it is gonna look up to the ASCII table and assign its corresponding character to it.

d. unsigned <data-type> can only store positive values. Its format specifier is %u

e. Type casting can be done by (<type-to-cast)<variable> while printing the value or even while assigning it to a new value.

f. for finding the length of an array, do sizeof(array)/sizeof(datatype).

g.
