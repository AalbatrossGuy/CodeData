state newton's 1st 2nd and 3rd law of motion.
proof: rate of change of momentum = mass * acceleration.

relation between N and dyne by explaining.

state gravitational law and explain it's mathematical form.

write down the S.I and C.G.S unit of 'G'

1kgf = ______ N & 1gf = _______dyne



Newton's first law of motion states that if a body is in a state of rest it will remain in the state of rest unless any external force is applied on it and if a body is at the state of motion, it will remain in the state of motion unless any external force is applied on it.

1N = 1k x 1metre per second square
1N = 1000g x 100cm 
1N = 10 to the power of 5 gram cm square.

gravitational law of motion states that the force of attraction between 2 bodies is directy proportional to the product of it's masses and inversly proportional to the square of it's distances.

S.I unit of 'G' is 6.67 x 10 to the power of -11 newton kg metre square.
