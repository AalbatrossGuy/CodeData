// A byte consists of eight smaller units called bits.
// 1 byte = 8 bits.
// Each 1 and 0 in a binary number system represent 1 bit. 1 = bit "turned on". 0 = bit "turned off".
// The rightmost bit of a byte is known as the least significant or low-order bit, and the leftmost bit is known as the most significant or high-order bit.
// Bytes are often referred to as words.
// Changing a bit to 1 is known as "setting the bit"
// Changing the bit to 0 is known as "resetting the bit"
// unsigned = +ve
// signed = -ve/+ve
// signed (negative) numbers are represented using two's complement notation.
// The leftmost bit represents the sign bit. 1 = -ve number and 0 = +ve number. The remaining bits represent the value of the number
// Bit manipulation in C allows the manipulation of individual bits in a variable.
// Left shifting a number by 'n' bits is equivalent to multiplying that number by 2^n.
// Right Shifting a number by 'n' bits is equivalent to dividing that number by 2^n.
