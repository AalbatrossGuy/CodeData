    // In order to declare a pointer that doesn't point to anything, do this:
    int *pExamplePointer = NULL;
    // int *pnumber = &number, assigns the address of number, i.e., 1008 to pnumber variable. The asterisk (*) makes it a pointer, which basically means that pnumber is pointing to the address of number
    // The pointer is a variable that points to an address in memory.
    // Syntax for defining a pointer -> <data type> *<variable name>. Best practice tells you to start a pointer with "p" followed by the name of the variable for which you're making the pointer.
    // Best practice tells you to give a space between asterisk (*) and the pointer name when declaring it and removing the space when dereferencing it.

    int result = *pMyNum + 10; // The value of a pointer can be dereferenced and added/subtracted in this manner.
    // to show the value of the address the pointer, pMyNum is pointing to, use *pMyNum when printing. This points to the value of the address, i.e., 100
    printf("The value of pMyNum is: %i and the address of the pointer is: 0x%p\n", *pMyNum, &pMyNum); // Calling the pointer to show the value of the address is called dereferencing a pointer.

    // In order to change the value, change it directly from the variable and not the pointer.

    // NOTE: Since the pointer was declared with a const keyword, the value of the address that it points to CANNOT be changed. However, the address of a variable that it points to CAN be changed!!!!!!
